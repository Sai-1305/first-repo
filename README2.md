## Cricket
This is another favorite sport of mine. Cricket is a sport which draws attention of a lot of people. The whole nation looks up to it. The national players will be under a lot of pressure. They require **strategy** and **patience** to handle the expectations of the nation-wide spectators. Similarly, even in the street-level matches, every person of the team will feel **responsible** for the team and tries to contribute with bat or ball or both. Nevertheless, cricketers require good **fitness** and have to be **consistent** with their play. At a personal level, I feel that cricket helps a person to be **fit**,**responsible**,**consistent** and **confident**.
